# Web Shop Node App (with React FE)

Initially started with a Node refresher course that mostly is based on the course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)
This project however expanded further and is using TypeScript and includes among many things:

- Node.js server
- integrated React frontend for better UI (client)
- MVC
- REST
- databases (MongoDB-Mongoose)
- Authentication (bcrypt and sessions) and Authorization
- CSRF
- APIs
- SendGrid for email sending
